Title: About Me
Date: 2016-01-02


I currently work as an operations engineer in the foreign exchange industry. I have studied Python for five years with some experience in Ruby, Javascript and C as well. I built this site using a simple DigitalOcean droplet, Python's Pelican library for static site generation and Ansible to automate the deployment of the site. Some of my hobbies include homebrewing, playing the guitar and clarinet and travelling.
